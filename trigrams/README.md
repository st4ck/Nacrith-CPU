# Trigram Tables

The trigram probability tables are too large for GitHub (88 MB).

Download them from the releases page https://github.com/st4ck/Nacrith-CPU/releases
or from HuggingFace https://huggingface.co/datasets/robtacconelli/Nacrith-Trigrams/tree/main

Place downloaded tables (one or more) in npz format in this directory before running compression.

Expected tables:
- `trigram_en.npz` (88 MB) - English text
